//! Gap analysis over an ALREADY DEPLOYED network. Two questions get called
//! "gaps" in the same breath and they are different failures:
//!
//! (A) COVERAGE GAPS — where do people live that no deployed repeater
//!     reaches? This is a point-to-area question, answered on a raster at one
//!     receiver height (`GapParams::rx_h_agl_m`): a handheld in the street.
//!
//! (B) BACKBONE GAPS — which repeaters cannot reach the rest of the network?
//!     This is a point-to-point question between two mounted antennas, each
//!     at its OWN height.
//!
//! Why they cannot be answered by the same raster: the coverage raster asks
//! "can a 1.5 m handheld here hear site X", and a repeater 18 m up on a roof
//! is not a 1.5 m handheld. A site sitting inside another site's green area
//! therefore says nothing about whether the two can talk, and a site in a
//! white area may still have a clean rooftop-to-rooftop path over the houses
//! that block the street. So (B) re-runs P.1812 per site PAIR with both real
//! heights instead of reading anything off (A).
//!
//! The failures are also different in kind. An isolated repeater still lights
//! up its neighbourhood on the (A) raster while being useless as
//! infrastructure: nothing it hears can get out of the neighbourhood. Merging
//! the two numbers hides exactly that, so they are reported separately and a
//! caller should show both.
//!
//! Everything here is offline: rasters come from the pack, sites come from the
//! caller. No network access at analysis time.

///
/// KNOWN LIMIT. A cell with good terrain data that sits in the RADIAL SHADOW
/// of a nodata hole is counted as uncovered, not as no-data: the sweep stops
/// at the hole (it has to — see the nodata note in `coverage`) but the cell
