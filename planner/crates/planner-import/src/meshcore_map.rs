//! MeshCore advert-map importer: the global node map served by
//! `map.meshcore.io/api/v1/nodes` as deployed-site records.
//!
//! This answers "what infrastructure already exists here", not "what did who
//! hear" -- an advert is a self-reported existence plus a self-reported
//! position, with no rx/tx pair and no SNR, so it deliberately does NOT become
//! an [`Observation`](crate::Observation): it cannot calibrate propagation, it
//! seeds the already-covered set that siting must not re-cover.
//! [`PositionQuality`] is reused because the one thing an advert does tell us
//! is how much to trust its coordinates.
//!
//! The front fetches the JSON and `planner-job nodes-import` turns it into a
//! nodeset. Nothing here touches the network -- the caller hands over
//! already-downloaded text, same contract as `potatomesh`, which keeps the
//! importer offline-testable.
//!
//! Shapes below are verified against the 2026-08-31 snapshot of the map
//! (59525 entries, 46 MB). What that snapshot
//! proves about the source, and why this file is defensive about it:
//! - Advert type histogram: 45263 repeaters (2), 11297 companions (1),
//!   2938 room servers (3), 27 sensors (4). No other code appeared, but an
//!   unknown code is preserved as [`MeshCoreKind::Other`] instead of being
//!   dropped in silence.
//! - `last_advert` is ALWAYS "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" in the snapshot, and
//!   ranges from 1969-12-31 to 2105-02-12. Both ends are node clocks that
//!   never got set. 4399 entries are dated after the fetch itself, 192 of them
//!   by more than a week and 175 by more than a year. A pure "older than N
//!   days" test therefore lets a broken clock look eternally fresh, which is
//!   why there is a separate future-skew guard.
//! - 8324 of 59525 `adv_name` values contain non-ASCII (mostly emoji), one
//!   Berlin name is blank, and names are not unique.
//! - `params` is present but sometimes empty (112 entries carry four nulls),
//!   and its numbers arrive as either ints or floats WITHIN THE SAME FIELD
//!   (`bw` is int in 2005 entries and float in 57408, `freq` int in 277) --
//!   hence f64 for all four, with sf/cr range-checked afterwards rather than
//!   decoded as integers.
//! - Inside the Berlin pack bbox (lon 13.033..13.810, lat 52.310..52.710) the
//!   snapshot holds 500 nodes: 395 repeaters, 69 companions, 36 room servers.
