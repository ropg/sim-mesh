"""Draw a run's ether record as a sequence diagram: one lifeline per station.

Every frame in `record.tsv` becomes one row — an arrow from the station that
transmitted it to each station the ether told about it, with the verdict at
each arrow head and what the frame was on the right.

  seq.py RUN                      the whole record of the run
  seq.py RUN --tail 40            the last forty frames
  seq.py RUN --only announce,path rows whose label matches any of these
  seq.py --record PATH            a record on its own: lifelines by id,
                                  or by --names 1=alpha,2=bravo

Lifelines are named from the run's nodeset. The record is the ether's own
account: it knows a frame's carrier, its air time and its bytes, and nothing
about what the bytes mean. The reading on the right is the protocol's: in a
run with Reticulum stations (or a record read on its own) it is done the way
an RNode-framed receive path does it (`sim_mesh.reticulum.frames.read_frame`);
in a run with none, a frame is its length and carrier.
