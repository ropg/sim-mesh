"""An old scenario as main's ground, nodeset and medium.

    convert_scenario.py OLD.yaml --out DIR --firmware KIND=FIRMWARE [--firmware ...]
                        [--name NAME] [--force]

OLD.yaml is a `scenario.yaml` of the format before geodata and nodesets: one
file with an origin, physics, kinds, first-boot lines, nodes, obstructions and
links (`-` reads it from standard input, and then --name is needed). It is
never written. The conversion goes to

    DIR/geodata/<name>.yaml      synthetic ground: the old exponent and shadowing
    DIR/nodesets/<name>.yaml     the nodes; walls and gains as offsets; links
    DIR/nodesets/<name>.py       the nodeset's own setup: each old kind's firmware
    DIR/medium.txt               the simd flags the old medium needs, one line
    DIR/conversion.txt           what went where, what did not, the distance check

laid out as testbed/ lays them out, so the three files copy straight in. Each
is read back through main's own reader before anything is written.

How each part goes over, and why:

- **Positions.** An old `pos` is [lat, lon] in degrees, and the old ether put
  a station on a plane in metres, equirectangular about the file's `origin`
  (`project` in its ether), and priced every pair by its distance there. The
  same projection is taken here, the points are centred on their centroid,
  and each is written at synthetic ground's degrees (a nautical mile to the
  minute on both axes), so every pair stands exactly as far apart as the old
  runs had it. `check_distances` holds every pair to that within
  CHECK_TOLERANCE_M, and also measures how far the old plane was from the
  great circle: the equirectangular error, about tan(latitude) times a node's
  latitude from the origin in radians, so at most 0.2 % in a city 20 km
  across at 50 degrees, 0.03 dB of loss. Both use the old ether's sphere; the
  WGS84 ellipsoid differs from it by up to 0.3 % at mid latitudes, in the old
  runs as here.
- **Heights.** The old format has none, so every node stands at main's
  default 2 m, marked assumed; a node's own `height_m`, which no old reader
  read, is carried where a file has one.
- **Antennas.** An old `gain_db` was isotropic, added at both ends of every
  pair in every direction. Every node gets `rubber_duck`: its 0 dBi peak
  points at the horizon, which is where every pair looks on flat ground with
  the antennas at one height, give or take the earth's curvature (under
  1e-4 dB a pair at 30 km), so it is the old 0 dB. Main's default whip would
  add 1.8 dB at each end. A gain that is not 0 has no antenna of its own (the
  catalogue's run from -4 to 11 dBi, each with a pattern), so it becomes
  offsets: -(G_a + G_b) on every pair a gain touches, which is what the old
  ether added, a stated link's pair included.
- **Walls.** An old obstruction is dB added to one pair both ways, on top of
  its distance loss or its stated link: main's offset exactly. One offset per
  pair carries the wall and the gains together, its note saying which.
- **Links.** An old link states a pair's loss outright, both ways, in place of
  its distance and its shadowing, with gains and walls still on it. It goes to
  the nodeset's `links:`, a layer over the loss table that states a pair's
  loss the same way, antennas and offsets still on it. It was flat in
  frequency; main moves a cell to the frame's carrier by 20*log10(f/f0),
  hundredths of a dB inside a band.
- **Kinds.** A node's old kind named its firmware, the kind's `elf`. The
  caller maps each kind to an installed firmware, by name or `<base>_latest`
  (--firmware KIND=FIRMWARE), and a node of a kind the mapping lacks is
  refused. A nodeset names no firmware, so each node is tagged with its kind,
  and the nodeset's own setup says each tag's firmware: scripts/startup.py
  includes it after a script's own .firmware(…), so its rules are the last to
  match.
- **First-boot lines**, each node's as the old testbed said them (the
  scenario's to its default kind, then the kind's, then the node's own), in
  the old kind's language: the role becomes the `transport` tag and the
  transmit power the node's `max_dbm`, which startup.py's radio sends at;
  main names a station and starts its radio itself. The other radio figures
  are scripts/globals.py's, one radio for every node, and a difference from
  it is warned of. Every other line goes to the setup as it was, to the same
  nodes in the same order, as on_first_boot() rules in the old kind's
  language: a kind is best mapped to a firmware of the project it was.
- **Ground.** Synthetic and flat, with the old exponent, over the square that
  holds every node. Shadowing (`shadowing_db`, `shadowing_seed`) goes to the
  geodata's keys of those names, which the shadowing layer over the loss
  table reads; the old ether drew none for a pair with a stated link.
- **Medium.** Main's medium figures are simd's flags: `--noise-figure`;
  `capture_model: bench` is `--bench-capture`, and the old default, a frame
  surviving each audible interferer by the capture margin, is `--pairwise`.
  What has no flag, a CRC band among them, is warned of.
