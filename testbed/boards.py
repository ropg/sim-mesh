"""The board: the radio hardware every node is, between its firmware and its antenna.

There is one board, an SX1262. A node's `max_dbm` in its nodeset is its
**maximum power**, in dBm at the antenna connector: 22 when it states none,
at most 27. At 22 dBm or below the node is a bare SX1262, the chip putting
out its maximum itself. Above 22 dBm it is an SX1262 behind a GC1109
front-end module (FEM), as a Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 is: the chip drives the
front end, whose measured transmit curve takes it to at most 27 dBm at the
connector, and which adds 20 dB of receive gain ahead of the chip.

A node's maximum power is what a station sends at: coverage and links draw
every node at it, the startup script's radio sets it (`tx_dbm="max"`), a
power a rule asks above it is held to it, a script's `max_tx_pwr(which)`
sets it, and a station's first-boot lines have it as `{max_dbm}`.

A station is told its board at start, `SIM_MESH_BOARD` in its environment (one
flat JSON object: the chip, the node's maximum, and the front end's figures
when it has one). The chip model applies the front end's curve and receive
gain from it, and firmware that models a front end at run time takes the
same figures.
