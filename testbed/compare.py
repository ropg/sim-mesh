"""Two runs of one nodeset and script, side by side, from their records.

    compare.py RUN_A RUN_B [--labels A,B] [--cli A.json B.json] [--logs]

    compare.py RUN_A                                            one run's figures

Each RUN is a run directory: its `record.tsv` is read, and the first run's
nodeset names the stations. A run in real time and a run in virtual time are
the same network only if the same things happen in both. Frame for frame
they cannot agree — the firmware draws its own random numbers — so this
compares what a run achieves and when. What a frame is (an announce, its
destination and hop count) is Reticulum's reading of it
(`simesh.reticulum.frames`):

- per station: when it joined the ether, when its radio first listened, the
  announces it originated and forwarded, its frames by type, and how many of
  its frames some receiver lost to a collision;
- per pair: the fewest hops at which one station heard the other's
  announces, which is the path the record shows it could have learned;
- milestones on the run's own clock, from the first hello (or from the zero
  `--starts` gives each run, such as the instant it was loaded): the last
  station to join, the last radio to listen, the first announce of the last
  station to announce, and the first path at each hop count.

With `--cli A.json B.json`, each run's final `rnpath` answers (a JSON object,
station name to what it printed) are compared too: paths known by hop count.
With `--logs`, the LXMF messages each run's senders logged as delivered
(`simesh.reticulum.delivery.log_deliveries`) are counted as well. `--until S`
keeps the first S seconds of each run, so a record that ran on while its run
was being stopped does not count the extra.
