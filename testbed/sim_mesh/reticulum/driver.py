"""The `reticulum` category: what every Reticulum firmware's driver answers.

```
script ── node(n).reticulum.lxmf.send(to, text) ──► simd: mid ──► lxmf.send(dest, text, mid) ──► station
station console ── its own id and its fate ──► driver.console_line ──► lxmf_status(mid, …)

```

A firmware of category `reticulum` ships a driver (`sim_mesh.driver`) whose
DRIVER subclasses `ReticulumDriver` and implements these verbs, beside every
firmware's (`Driver`: name, radio, radio_up, tx_power, diagnostics). Each
takes the station first; a verb a firmware cannot do raises `CommandError`
(`self.cannot(verb)` makes one), and the default here does exactly that. A
verb with a dot is the method with an underscore: `lxmf.send` is
`lxmf_send`. A script reaches them as `<selection>.reticulum.<verb>`.

    role(station, role)                 "transport" (forwards for others) or "client"
    path(station, dest=None, iface=None)
                                        its path table: [{dest, next_hop, iface,
                                        hops}], the entries for `dest` (32 hex
                                        digits) and on `iface` (as the firmware
                                        names it) when given, all without
    peer_tcp(station, addr, port)       a TCP link to another station
    current_role(station)               what it does now, one of ROLES, or None

and LXMF's, where an identity is named by its display name (the name its
announces carry), which a run keeps unique:

    lxmf.create(station, name)          one more LXMF identity, named `name`,
                                        unless the station has one by that
                                        name; returns its delivery address,
                                        or None while it has none yet. Never
                                        refuses, so a script may say it every
                                        time: a firmware with one identity,
                                        there from its start and named after
                                        the node, gives it `name` instead, and
                                        once it has another name does nothing
                                        and returns None.
    lxmf.identities(station)            [(name, delivery address)], the one it
                                        sends from unless told otherwise
                                        first; [] while it has none
    lxmf.announce(station, name=None)   announce the delivery destination of
                                        its identity `name` (None: the first)
    lxmf.send(station, dest, text, mid, sender=None)
                                        an LXMF message to `dest` (32 hex
                                        digits) from its identity `sender`
                                        (None: the first); `mid` is the
                                        message's id, sim-mesh's

**What became of a message** is reported against `mid`, from `console_line`
or however else the driver learns it:

    self.lxmf_status(station, mid, "pending" | "sent" | "delivered" | "failed",
                     why=<text>)

which is `station.report("lxmf.message.status", mid=, status=, why=)`; the
last status a message reached is what a traffic report shows for one that
never arrived. A firmware has ids of its own, which it may give a message
only once it is built (after a path has been found, say): a driver couples
one to sim-mesh's when it learns it (`lxmf_couple`), and reports what the
station says of its own id with `lxmf_native`, which holds what comes before
the coupling and reports it once it is made. What goes wrong before the
firmware has an id is reported against `mid` directly.
