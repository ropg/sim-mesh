"""What a script says to a simulation and its stations, whatever firmware they run.

    '''smoke: an LXMF identity everywhere, then an announce.'''
    from sim_mesh import *

    time("real")
    firmware("all", "reticulous_dev_latest")
    include("scripts/startup.py")
    on_first_boot("all", '''
        lxmf create {name}
    ''')

    up("all")
    announce(nodes(tag="lora"), spread=60)
    wait(600)
    send_msg("gw02", "internet", "hello")

A script is plain Python, run from its top to its end (sim_mesh.runner):
every call below does what it says and returns when it has, so a script is
read as it runs. Time is the run's own clock, so a real-time and a
virtual-time run act at the same instants of the run.

**Declarations**, before anything is done:

- `time(mode)`: `"real"`, `"max"` (virtual time as fast as the stations
  allow) or a number, virtual time paced at that many times the wall.
  Real by default. It is the simulation's for its whole life.
- `firmware(which, device)`: what the nodes run, a device as the Devices tab
  names it (`reticulous_dev_latest`, `reticulous_dev_20260927140352`). Each
  node runs what the last rule matching it names; a node no rule matches
  runs nothing.
- `on_first_boot(which, cmds)`: what each matching station is given the
  first time it boots with no state (every station of a new simulation, a
  node placed later, a station after a factory reset), after its name.
  `cmds` is lines in the station's own language, or intents said in each
  kind's own lines, or a list of both: `radio(freq_mhz, sf, bw_khz, cr,
  tx_dbm, sync, preamble)` sets slot 0 (`tx_dbm="max"` is each node's own
  maximum), `radio_up()` starts it, after whatever it reads when it starts,
  and `role(name)` sets its role. Rules apply in order.

Nothing about a station is said to it but what a script says: the radio,
the role and the rest come from these rules, most of them from
`scripts/startup.py`, which a script includes:

- `include(path, missing_ok=False)`: another file's code, run here as if
  written at this point; `path` is under testbed/.
- `nodesets()`: the names of the nodesets the script's world is made of,
  for including each one's own setup (`nodesets/<name>.py`).

The first thing a script does (or its end) starts the simulation with
those: on the Nodes tab's geodata and nodesets when the page ran it, or on
`--geodata`/`--nodeset` from a shell. A script run on a running simulation
(`--sim`) says its firmware and first-boot rules to that one instead, and
cannot change its time. Said later, `firmware()` and `on_first_boot()` apply
to the running simulation at once: a node whose firmware changes is
restarted on it, its state kept.

**What is done** (each waits for the nodes it names to be up first; a node
with no firmware refuses):

- `exec(which, cmds, pause=0)`: lines in each node's own language, macros
  filled in (`{name}`, `{id}`, `{addr}`, `{addr:<node>}`, `{max_dbm}`). The
  nodes go together, or one after another `pause` seconds apart. Answers
  {node: what it printed}.
- meta commands, said in each kind's own lines: `announce(which,
  spread=0)`, `max_tx_pwr(which, dbm=None)` (each node's own maximum when no
  figure is given), `send_msg(from_node, to_node, text)`.
- `reset(which)`, `factory_reset(which)`: pressed on each.
- `up(which)`: until they are all up. `wait(seconds)`, `until(seconds)`,
  `now()`: the run's clock, in seconds since the script's simulation began.
- `phase(name, until)…`: what the run is doing, for the page's estimate.
- `snapshot(name)`, `move(node, lat, lon)`, `pause()`, `stop()`.
- `stations()`, `station(name)`: each node's facts, its `max_dbm` among them.

`send_msg` and `exec` take `after=` (seconds on the run's clock before it is
done) and `wait=False`, which returns at once with a future whose
`result()` is the answer: how a driver puts many things on the clock at once.

**Which nodes** is `"all"`, a node's name, a list of names, or a selection,
`nodes(field=value, …)` (sim_mesh.select), combined with `&`, `|`, `-`, `~`.
