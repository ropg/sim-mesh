"""The LXMF traffic driver: a whole run, on the run's own clock, on any
firmware of category `reticulum` (sim_mesh.reticulum.driver).

    from sim_mesh import *
    from sim_mesh import traffic

    firmware = script_input("firmware", type=Firmware, category="reticulum")

    nodes().firmware(firmware)

    traffic.run(OPTIONS)                    # into the run directory as traffic.json
    sim_pause()

Phases, each skipped when its option says so:

  up        wait until every station is up.
  identity  each station's LXMF delivery address (the first the
            `lxmf.identities` verb lists), asked until every station has one.
  warm      rounds of announces across the stations (the `lxmf.announce` verb;
            warm_rounds, each spread over warm_spread seconds with warm_gap
            between rounds), then, on the stations whose firmware can list
            its paths (the `path` verb), a sample every settle_every seconds
            until their total does not rise between two samples (or
            settle_max has passed). With no such station, two settle_every
            waits. warm_rounds 0 skips the phase.
  snapshot  a snapshot, warm_snapshot, when given.
  traffic   one message every `every` seconds for `traffic` seconds (the
            `lxmf.send` verb), the sender, recipient, size class
            and text all drawn from `seed`, so two runs with one seed and
            one set of station names send the same messages at the same
            instants after the traffic starts. `arrivals` "poisson", `pairs`
            and `hub` vary when the messages go and between whom, keeping
            the messages themselves (`schedule`). Each send is preceded by
            the `path` verb at the sender, the route length at send time
            where the firmware can say it. Size classes: short 20-55
            characters, two-frame 115-300, and 420-650 (over 500 B on the
            wire: a link and a resource), weighted 167 : 76 : 39. Every text
            starts with its marker, `marker` and a four-digit number.
  drain     `drain` seconds after the last send slot.
  gather    with `gather`, every station's `diagnostics`.
  snapshot  end_snapshot, when given.

Once every station is up the driver says the run's phases (warm-up,
traffic and drain, each with the T it ends at), and again whenever warm-up
runs longer, so the page can say which phase the run is in and when it will
be done. The result holds the phases (wall and T at each boundary), every
clock message, the warm-up samples, every send with its route, message id
and reply, and the gathered output. How much of it was delivered is counted
afterwards from the run's events, what each sender's driver reported of
each message (sim_mesh.reticulum.delivery, `report`).
