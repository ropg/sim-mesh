"""Loss tables: every ordered pair's path loss, for one nodeset on one geodata.

    python3 losses.py --geodata G --nodeset N --band 868 [--sidecar URL] [--out PATH]
    python3 losses.py --geodata G --nodeset N --band 868 --table PATH --node NAME ...

A table is derived, never edited: it follows from the geodata and the
nodeset's geometry, and is cached as

    testbed/losses/<geodata>/<nodeset geometry hash>/<band>.bin

(`<band>-loc<pct>.bin` for a pack whose geodata states `loc_pct`) in the
SLT1 format (`ether/slt.py`). A run works on its own copy; a node
moved during a run has its row and column recomputed into that copy, never
into the cache.

A nodeset's **links**, **antennas** and **offsets** and the geodata's
**shadowing** are not in the table: they are layers over it, put on when
the medium is given the tables (`medium_tables`), so the cached table is
the model's own and none of them forces a recompute. A link states a pair's
loss in place of the model's. Shadowing adds each pair's own static draw,
off unless the geodata asks for it. The antenna layer takes each pair's
gains off its loss, each end's pattern toward the other in three
dimensions, which needs the ground under each node (`grounds`: 0 on
synthetic ground, the pack's terrain through the sidecar).

Synthetic ground is computed here:

    loss = FSPL(1 m, f0) + 10·n·log10(max(d, 1 m))

with d measured on the ground's plane, heights playing no part on flat
terrain. The table is symmetric and its model is "log-distance".

Packs are computed through a running planner sidecar's `/link.json`,
one request per ordered pair: the answer is not reciprocal, because the
terminal clutter and heights at the two ends enter P.1812 differently (2.5 dB
apart on a 300 m Mitte path with antennas at 38 m and 30 m), so each
direction's cell is what `link.json` says of that direction. Each
request gives both ends' antenna heights from the nodeset, in the pack's own
CRS, and takes `lb_db`, the loss with the terminal clutter at both ends.
Gains are not sent: they are the antenna layer's to add. What the sidecar cannot
answer is decided here, without asking:

- an end outside the pack's extent: never heard, FLAG_OFF_PACK (the sidecar
  would clamp the point onto the pack's edge and answer for a place the
  node is not);
- farther apart than the compute radius (30 km unless told otherwise):
  never heard, FLAG_BEYOND_RADIUS. A pair too weak to carry a frame is still
  computed, because it still adds to a receiver's interference; the radius
  is only a bound on the work;
- under 20 m apart, which the sidecar refuses: free space at that distance,
  FLAG_NEAR_FIELD.

From a reply, FLAG_NEAR_FIELD when its model is the near-field one rather
than P.1812, and FLAG_LOS_CLEAR when its Fresnel verdict is "clear". A
refusal for a path that leaves the pack or exceeds the sidecar's window cap
is never heard with the matching flag; "path too short for a §3.2 profile",
which the sidecar says of pairs a few tens of metres apart whose profile
decimates to fewer than three points, is free space at that distance,
FLAG_NEAR_FIELD, as under 20 m; "renderer busy" (429) is retried after a
growing pause. Requests run concurrently up to a bound near the sidecar's
render slots, though the sidecar holds its raster locks for the whole of a
`link.json`, so requests are answered one at a time whatever the bound:
about 2.5 ms a request, two requests a pair.

A sidecar indexes its pack's buildings in the background after it starts
(a second for the berlin-city pack, half a minute for all of Berlin), and
until then `link.json` answers from the clutter raster alone: a different
number, 40 dB off on a 300 m Mitte path,
which a cache would keep. So before its first pair a table asks a probe pair
until the reply's `profile_evidence.buildings_index` is "ready" or "absent",
saying so as a notice while it waits (bounded; past the bound the table is
refused), and a cell answered "loading" all the same is thrown away and
asked again once the index is in. The same holds for a node's row and
column.

The command prints JSON lines: `{"event": "progress", "done", "total"}`,
`{"event": "notice", "message"}` while it waits on the sidecar, then
`{"event": "done", "path", "cached", "n"}` or `{"event": "error", "message"}`.

`link.json` takes no carrier: it always judges at the planner's EU868 link
parameters, 869.525 MHz, 50 % of time and 90 % of locations. So a pack
has an 868 table only, its header's `f0_hz` is 869.525 MHz, the carrier the
numbers are really for, and asking for another band is refused. The
percentage of locations is the one thing a request may change: a geodata's
`loc_pct` goes to every request as `loc_pct` and into the header as
`p_loc_pct`, and a geodata without one asks exactly as before, at 90 %. The
key is in the geodata's content hash and in the cached file's name, so a
table at 50 % never serves one at 90 %, from the cache or as another
table's donor, and the two are cached side by side.
