"""Antennas: what a node radiates with, as gain by direction.

    testbed/antennas/catalogue.yaml     every antenna there is, by type
    testbed/antennas/<type>.svg         its picture, for the Antennas tab

A node carries one antenna, `antenna: { type, azimuth_deg?, elevation_deg? }`
in its nodeset; a directional one is aimed by its azimuth (degrees clockwise
from grid north) and its elevation (degrees above the horizon), an omni is
the same all round and neither applies.

**The pattern** is made from a few figures per type (the catalogue's header
says what each is). The loss below the peak in a direction is the vertical
term, `12·((el − tilt) / vbw)²`, plus for a directional antenna the
horizontal one, `12·(az / hbw)²`, together never more than `floor_db`: each
term is 3 dB at half its beamwidth, as a half-power beamwidth says, and the
floor stands for the side lobes, the back and what the case fills in. `el`
and `az` are measured from where the antenna points. The same formula is on
the page (ui/src/lib/antennas.ts), which draws it and uses it for coverage.

**Between two nodes** the direction is the line between their antennas, in
three dimensions: the azimuth from one's position to the other's, and the
elevation of the line from one's antenna (the ground under it plus its
height) to the other's, with the earth's curvature at the effective radius
(k = 4/3) taking its drop off the far end. So a pair's gain is the sum of
each end's gain toward the other, and a low node under a high collinear's
narrow beam hears less of it than one on the horizon.
