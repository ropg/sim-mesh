One front process owns the port the container publishes. It keeps the
registry of simulations, gives each one a control port, an ether port, a
loopback /22 and a run directory, and starts one **child** per simulation:
an ordinary simd, as a subprocess with the flags a person would give it by
hand. A child keeps its own event loop and its own pace, and a crash in one
simulation ends that one; the registry keeps it, exited, with the last lines
it wrote, until it is stopped.

**Before a child starts** its run is made whole here: the geodata and the
nodeset are loaded and checked, the loss table of every band the nodes'
carriers use is taken from the cache or computed into it by `losses.py` as a
subprocess, whose progress goes to every page, and the run directory is laid
out by `runs.create_run` (or `runs.load_snapshot`). The child is then
started on that directory and loads it itself, settling each node's firmware
from its script's `.firmware(…)` declarations.

**The planner sidecar.** One `planner-web` per pack in use, on
`127.0.0.1:<free>`: started when the first simulation or page socket opens
geodata on that pack, stopped SIDECAR_GRACE_S after the last one lets go
unless one holds it again by then, as a reloaded page does. It is sim-mesh's own,
built from `planner/` (by `sim` as it starts) to
`planner/target/release/planner-web`; not built, a pack is refused with
NO_PLANNER and synthetic ground works. The page reaches it as `/planner/<geodata>/…`, passed through with
the prefix stripped; a child is given its URL directly, for recomputing a
moved node's row. It is given the coverage cache (`--coverage-dir`), whose
rasters it combines into the bands of the view the page shows
(`/coverage/bands.bin`).

**Script runs.** A script runs as a process of its own (`sim_mesh.runner`),
its output kept (the last `SCRIPT_LINES` lines) and sent to every page as it
comes. On a new simulation it starts that itself, through `sim_new` on this
same port, with its time and its firmware and first-boot rules, under the
name the front chose when it was asked to run it, so the page can go to it
at once; or it runs on a simulation already running. Either way the
simulation runs on when the script ends, unless the script paused or
stopped it; a paused one stays in the registry until it is resumed (in a
new run directory, from its state) or removed. A script's
`report(run_dir)` then writes the run's `report.md`, which `/api/report`
serves.

The front's control websocket speaks the child's messages (simd.py lists
them) and these of its own, each answered to the asking socket as
`{type: <verb>, ok: true, …}` or `{type: <verb>, ok: false, error}`:

`pairwise: true` in `sim_new` starts that simulation's ether on the pairwise
rule (simd's `--pairwise`); the front's own `-- --pairwise` does it for every
simulation.

`sim_load {geodata, nodeset, script?}` and `snapshot_load {name}` sent to a
running simulation pass through the front on their way: it computes the
tables and holds the sidecar first, with progress as for `sim_new`, and adds
`sidecar` before handing the message on.

`?sim=<name>` on the websocket selects that simulation from the start, and
`?quiet=1` asks every child for its quiet stream (no tx, rx, radio or levels).

Station hostnames carry the simulation: `<station>.<sim>.sim.localhost`. The
front routes on the second label and the child on the first. A bare
`<station>.sim.localhost` reaches the one simulation while exactly one runs. The
WebRTC relay is the child's own mechanism, one level up: the front terminates
the signalling, points the answer at itself, and forwards the UDP flow to the
child's relay.

Nothing here blocks: the children's, the sidecars', the scripts' and the loss
computation's output is read as it comes, files are laid out and zips
expanded on a worker thread, and every wait is an awaitable.
