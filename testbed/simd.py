```

One command starts this, and this is the whole testbed. It holds

- the `Ether` and its UDP endpoint, in this process's own event loop, so the
  loss tables reach the medium by direct call and never over a wire;
- the stations, one firmware process on a pty each, with a supervisor apiece;
- one listener on the bind port, which routes by `Host`: a
  `<name|id>.sim.localhost` request is proxied to that station's own web UI,
  and everything else is the control page and its websockets;
- the loaded **run** (runs.py): the geodata, the run's own copy of the
  nodeset, the script's copy when it has one, the loss tables the ether
  reads, and every station's directory. A run is made from geodata, a
  nodeset and optionally a script (`sim_load`) or from a snapshot
  (`snapshot_load`), or is handed over made already (`--run`, which is how
  the front starts a simulation).

Several of these run at once as the children of front.py, each on its own
ports, network and run directory, with the front in front of all of them.

**Firmware.** What each node runs is said by firmware rules, `{which,
firmware}`: a selection of nodes (simesh.select) and a device name. A run
is made with its script's rules (`sim_load`'s `firmware_rules`, which the
front has from the script's runner) and takes more from a `firmware`
message; they are kept in the run (`firmware_rules`), and each node runs
what the last rule matching it names (`firmware`), fetched when it is a
`_latest` not here yet. A node no rule matches runs nothing and is not
started; a node placed later is matched as it lands. A node whose firmware
a new rule changes is restarted on it, its state kept.

**First boot.** A station that boots with no state is set up: its name in
its kind's own lines, then what its first-boot rules give it (`{which,
lines}`, the script's `on_first_boot()`, kept in the run as
`first_boot_rules` and added to by a `first_boot` message), in order: a
line as written, an intent (`{intent, args}`: its role, its radio) in the
kind's lines, a transmit power of "max" or above the node's maximum held to
that maximum. Nothing else is said: the nodeset declares no settings, and a
radio starts when a rule says so. No script code runs here: the rules are
data. A station with state is left alone. Lines have `{max_dbm}`, the
node's maximum power, among their macros.

Loss tables. The run holds one table per band its nodes' carriers use
(`losses.bands_of`), and the ether rules on every frame from them, with the
nodes' antennas and the nodeset's offsets on them (`losses.medium_tables`);
the antennas need the ground under each node, which is asked of the sidecar
on a pack (`losses.grounds`) and kept in the run as `grounds`. A nodeset edit that changes
the geometry (a move, a height, a node added) recomputes the touched nodes'
rows and columns into the run's copy, as a task: through the planner sidecar
named by `--sidecar` or by the load that brought the geodata in, or on
synthetic ground here. Until a row lands the ether keeps the old one, and the
node's `node` message says `stale: true`. The cache in `losses/` is never
written by an edit.

**Choosing stations.** `command` and `meta` go to the stations that are up
(or in setup) among the ones named: `name`, a list of `names`, every one
carrying `tag`, or all of them. A line is in one kind's language, so the
chosen stations must all be of one kind, or `kind` must narrow them to one;
an intent goes to every kind, each in its own lines. `meta`'s verbs are the
intents (kinds.INTENTS) and `address`, each station's LXMF delivery address;
`message` and `path` take `to`, a node's name, whose address is asked of it
first, and `peer_tcp` takes `to` and `port`.

`role` is what the station's kind reads from it (kinds.ROLES), polled; None
when the kind cannot say. `?quiet=1` on the websocket leaves out tx, rx, radio and levels,
which is most of the traffic on a busy network and nothing a driver or the
front's registry reads. See INTERNALS.md for why it is shaped this way.

Nothing here blocks. Every wait is an awaitable, the stations' ptys are read
on a thread of their own (stations.Ptys) that hands this loop what it acts
on, and a framed-RPC query is a future that a reply handed over completes.
