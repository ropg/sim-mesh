"""The referee: what a run's record says each station did on the air, judged.

    referee.py --run RUN [--json] [--detail]

The ether decides who hears what and keeps no opinion about how a station
behaved; its record is there so that something else can form one. This reads
a finished run's `record.tsv` against the run's own medium (`RunView.medium()`,
asked through the ether's `level` and `audible`) and reports:

- **carrier sense**: every transmission that began while a frame on its
  carrier, one its sender could decode, was on the air. Whether the ether
  had told the sender's slot of that frame before it began: **told**, by an
  rx_begin at the frame's start; **told late**, by one mid-frame, which is
  what a slot coming to RX or CAD while the frame is on the air gets from an
  ether run with `--late-listeners`; or **never told**. And the window of
  that frame it began in: **blind**, its first four symbols, in which nothing
  has found it yet; **preamble**; or **payload**. An rx_begin marked `cad` is
  energy (the sense threshold crossed, or a frame that did not take the
  receiver); one without is a lock. Either is telling. Each comes with the
  mode the sender's slot had last stated when that frame went out;
- **frames nobody was told of**, by sender and channel: a station on a
  channel nobody listens to shows up here;
- **collisions**: every reception that ended `crc` for anything but noise
  (the ether's `cause`), with each other
  transmission that shared its air and band and reached the receiver, split
  into senders **hidden** from each other, neither able to decode the
  other, and senders **in earshot**, one or both able to. A receiver that
  was itself sending lost the frame to half duplex, and a sender with two
  frames on the air at once (**same**) is neither; both are counted apart.

Duty cycle and power are `compliance.py`'s, against EN 300 220-2 annex B
per band entry, with e.r.p. and polite spectrum access. This tool's earlier
duty section put 863–865 MHz at 1 %, where the entry allows 0.1 %, and
ignored power; it is gone.

Whether a station sensed the channel before it talked is not in the record:
that its slot was in RX or CAD is, but an RSSI read or a CAD's result never
reaches the ether. What is judged is what the ether told the slot, which is
all its firmware had to go on.

A reception is tied to its transmission by the ether's number for the
frame, which rx_begin and rx_end carry and `tx` does not. A real-time ether
numbers transmissions in the order it records them. A virtual-time one
numbers each T's in the order its barrier takes them, station by station,
and there T is the record's own clock: an rx_begin names the instants its
frame's preamble, header and air end, which pin the frame, and frames alike
in all three take their numbers in the barrier's order. Levels are the
run's as it ended.
