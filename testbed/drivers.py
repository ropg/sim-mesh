"""Drivers, host side: a run's firmware resolved and each one's driver loaded.

```
script nodes().firmware("<base>_latest") ──► resolve_builds ──► firmware.resolve
run.yaml builds: {"<base>_latest": {firmware: <name>, …}}    what each name ran on
load(build) ──► import <firmware dir>/<driver>.py ──► DRIVER(firmware) ──► a station's driver
```

A run names firmware as scripts do, by name or `<base>_latest`; each is
resolved once, when a rule first names it, to an installed firmware
(firmware.py), and the run keeps what it resolved to in `run.yaml`'s
`builds`, so a paused run and a snapshot say which firmware wrote their
state. The driver is the firmware's own module (sim_mesh.driver); this
imports it from the firmware's directory under a module name of its own, so
two firmwares' drivers never meet.

`env` is the station contract's environment, which sim-mesh gives every
station before the firmware's `env` and its driver's: the node's identity,
directory, address and ether, its board, the virtual radio's library, and in
a virtual-time run the time shim.

Lines keep `{name}`, `{id}`, `{addr}` and `{addr:<node>}` macros until a
station is given them (`expand`).
