"""A nodeset: which nodes stand where, with what antenna, and what they are.

    testbed/nodesets/<name>.yaml
    testbed/nodesets/<name>.py        its own setup, when it has one (script.py)

    nodes:
      gw-alex: { id: 1, lat: 52.5219, lon: 13.4132, height_m: 38, height_from: roof,
                 max_dbm: 27,
                 antenna: { type: panel_directional, azimuth_deg: 120, elevation_deg: -2 },
                 tags: [transport, gateway] }
      n017: { id: 2, lat: 52.5301, lon: 13.4018, height_m: 15, height_from: assumed,
              antenna: { type: whip_sma_quarter_wave }, tags: [rooftop] }
    offsets:
      - { between: [gw-alex, n017], db: 40, note: "wall, measured 2026-09-20" }

A node is its position, its antenna's height above the ground under it and
where that figure came from (`measured`, `roof`, `raster`, `assumed`), its
maximum power (`max_dbm`, dBm at the antenna connector, 22 when absent and
at most 27; above 22 the node has a front end, boards.py), its antenna
(antennas.py: a type of the catalogue, and a directional one's aim), and its
tags. A node has no board: every node is the one board boards.py
describes. Nothing in it is said to a station: scripts say everything, in
the node's terms, keyed off its tags.
Two tags mean something to the page and the analysis as well:

- a role's name (`transport`, `router`, `repeater`) is the node's role
  (`tag_role`), which the startup script tells it and the map rings;
- `no-radio` is a node with no radio: the startup script sets up every
  other node's, to globals.py's settings, and the page draws coverage and
  links for those alone.

What a node runs is not the nodeset's either: a script says it
(`.firmware(…)`), so one nodeset is run on any firmware.

A nodeset names no geodata. It is offered on every geodata whose extent holds
one of its nodes (`inside`); synthetic ground lies at 0°, 0°.

A node's name is how everything refers to it: scripts, offsets, links,
snapshots and the page. Its id is its network identity, stored and
editable: the station's loopback address and MAC follow from it
(`stations.bind_addr`), so changing it moves the station, and anything
already set up with its old `{id}` or `{addr}` is stale. A new node takes
the lowest id not in use.

**Offsets** are dB added to the computed loss of one pair, both ways, on any
geodata: where a measurement says the model is wrong, and by how much. They
are a layer over the loss table, applied when the medium is given it, so the
table itself (`geometry_hash`: which nodes, where, how high) is cached
without them and an offset never forces a recompute.

**Links** state a pair's loss outright, where a better figure than the
model's is known, measured or worked out elsewhere:

    links:
      - { between: [a, b], loss_db: 131.5, back_db: 133, note: measured }

a→b is `loss_db` and b→a `back_db`, `loss_db` again when it has none, the
same figure in every band with no correction between bands. A link is a
layer too (`losses.with_links`): it stands in for the model's loss and the
geodata's shadowing, and the antennas and any offset still go on top of it.
A file without links has no `links:` key, and is written back without one.
