```

A raster is the planner's own point-to-area sweep (`planner-coverage`) from
the node's antenna to a receiver `RX_HEIGHT_M` above the ground everywhere
within `RADIUS_KM`, as its `loss.bin` serves it:

    "PLS2" | u32 w | u32 h | f64 ox | f64 oy | f64 rx | f64 ry | u16 loss_db·100 [w·h]

in the pack's CRS, row-major from the north-west, `(ox, oy)` the centre of
the first cell, 65535 where nothing was evaluated. Its cells are the pack's
own, up to `CELLS` across the square (planner-web answers no finer than the
sweep, and no more than 2048 a side): 10 m on a 10 m pack, 30 m on a 30 m
one, about 10 m on anything finer. It is path loss only:
the page adds the node's transmit power and antenna gain, and draws the best
level at each point over the nodes on show.

A raster depends on the pack and the node's position and height alone, so
its key is those (`key`): moving a node or changing its height is a new
raster, and changing its power, gain or radio is not. The sidecar computes
one sweep at a time and a new one cancels the last, so the front asks for
one node at a time per sidecar, and for the whole radius at once (`whole`,
where the sidecar lists it) rather than the ladder of growing bands its map
paints while it waits: the last band is the same raster without the others.
A sweep waits for the sidecar's building index, so no raster is computed
without the buildings around its node. Synthetic ground has no rasters: its
log-distance loss is a formula the page works out itself.
