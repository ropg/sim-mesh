"""The ether's record, `record.tsv`: one line per message, in the order the
ether took or sent them.

    <stamp> TAB <in|out> TAB <station id> TAB <the message as JSON>

The stamp is T in seconds in a virtual-time run and the wall clock's ISO
time in a real one. A line starting `#` is a comment (the ether writes one
each time it opens the file). `in` is what a station told the ether (`hello`,
`state`, `tx`), `out` what the ether told a station (`welcome`, `rx_begin`,
`rx_end`). The record knows a frame's carrier, air time and bytes, and
nothing about what the bytes mean.
