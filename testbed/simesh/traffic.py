"""The LXMF traffic driver: a whole run, on the run's own clock, on any
firmware whose kind can say an address, an announce and a message.

    traffic.run(OPTIONS)                    # into the run directory as traffic.json
    pause()

Phases, each skipped when its option says so:

  up        wait until every station is up.
  identity  each station's LXMF delivery address (the `address` meta
            command), asked until every station has one.
  warm      rounds of announces across the stations (the `announce` meta
            command; warm_rounds, each spread over warm_spread seconds with
            warm_gap between rounds), then, on the stations whose kind can
            count its paths (`reticulous`: `rnpath -s`), a sample every
            settle_every seconds until their total does not rise between
            two samples (or settle_max has passed). With no such station,
            two settle_every waits. warm_rounds 0 skips the phase.
  snapshot  a snapshot, warm_snapshot, when given.
  traffic   one message every `every` seconds for `traffic` seconds (the
            `message` meta command, `send_msg`), the sender, recipient,
            size class and text all drawn from `seed`, so two runs with one
            seed and one set of station names send the same messages at the
            same instants after the traffic starts. Each send is preceded
            by the `path` meta command at the sender, the route length at
            send time where the kind can say it. Size classes: short 20-55
            characters, two-frame 115-300, and 420-650 (over 500 B on the
            wire: a link and a resource), weighted 167 : 76 : 39. Every text
            starts with its marker, `marker` and a four-digit number.
  drain     `drain` seconds after the last send slot.
  gather    every `gather` line on the stations of each kind it names.
  snapshot  end_snapshot, when given.

Once every station is up the driver says the run's phases (warm-up,
traffic and drain, each with the T it ends at), and again whenever warm-up
runs longer, so the page can say which phase the run is in and when it will
be done. The result holds the phases (wall and T at each boundary), every
clock message, the warm-up samples, every send with its route and reply,
and the gathered output. How much of it was delivered is counted from the
stations' logs afterwards, each sender by its own station's
(simesh.reticulum.delivery, `report`).
