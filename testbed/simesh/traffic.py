"""The LXMF traffic driver: a whole run, on the run's own clock, on any
firmware whose kind can say an address, an announce and a message.

    pause()

Phases, each skipped when its option says so:

  up        wait until every station is up.
  identity  each station's LXMF delivery address (the `address` meta
            command), asked until every station has one.
  warm      rounds of announces across the stations (the `announce` meta
            command; warm_rounds, each spread over warm_spread seconds with
            warm_gap between rounds), then, on the stations whose kind can
            count its paths (`reticulous`: `rnpath -s`;
            `standard_reticulum`: `paths`), a sample every
            settle_every seconds until their total does not rise between
            two samples (or settle_max has passed). With no such station,
            two settle_every waits. warm_rounds 0 skips the phase.
  snapshot  a snapshot, warm_snapshot, when given.
  traffic   one message every `every` seconds for `traffic` seconds (the
            `message` meta command, `send_msg`), the sender, recipient,
            size class and text all drawn from `seed`, so two runs with one
            seed and one set of station names send the same messages at the
            same instants after the traffic starts. `arrivals`
            "poisson", `pairs` and `hub` vary when the messages go and
            between whom, keeping the messages themselves (`schedule`).
            Each send is preceded
            by the `path` meta command at the sender, the route length at
            send time where the kind can say it. Size classes: short 20-55
            characters, two-frame 115-300, and 420-650 (over 500 B on the
            wire: a link and a resource), weighted 167 : 76 : 39. Every text
            starts with its marker, `marker` and a four-digit number.
  drain     `drain` seconds after the last send slot.
  gather    every `gather` line on the stations of each kind it names.
  snapshot  end_snapshot, when given.

Once every station is up the driver says the run's phases (warm-up,
traffic and drain, each with the T it ends at), and again whenever warm-up
runs longer, so the page can say which phase the run is in and when it will
be done. The result holds the phases (wall and T at each boundary), every
clock message, the warm-up samples, every send with its route and reply,
and the gathered output. How much of it was delivered is counted from the
stations' logs afterwards, each sender by its own station's: the lines
`reticulous` and `standard_reticulum` stations log, and a station configured
with rncfg (`sergeyculum`) by its own (simesh.reticulum.delivery, `report`).
