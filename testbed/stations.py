"""One firmware process, its pty, its log and its supervisor.

A station is a whole firmware built for Linux and run as an ordinary process,
keeping the station contract (STATION.md); its kind (kinds/) says which
binary and how to talk to it. It gets:

- a **directory** in the run, `runs/<run>/nodes/<name>/`, its cwd, with its
  state under `state/`;
- a **pty**, because its stdin and stdout are its serial console — the
  supervisor holds the master end and reads it on the pty thread (`Ptys`),
  which takes framed-RPC replies out of what the station writes (rpc.py) and
  hands them to the station's client, appends everything else to `log`, and
  passes the same bytes to whoever is watching the console; or, for a kind
  whose console need not be a terminal (`console_tty`), a pipe each way,
  read the same way, which holds none of the host's ptys;
- a **loopback address** its id fixes in the testbed's network (`bind_addr`),
  where its sockets bind;
- a **supervisor** that starts it again when it exits, because a restart on
  this target is a process exit.

Status is what the map draws: `stopped` before anything is started and after
it is told to stop, `starting` from the fork until its kind says it is up, `setup`
while its setup lines are going in, `up` once it is answering, `restarting`
in the gap after an unasked-for exit. Nothing here decides when `setup`
happens — the caller does that, through `on_status`.
