/**
 * ether_link — the station's one link to the ether.
 *
 * One UDP socket and one reader. Outbound: everything a chip model does that
 * anyone else could observe — the mode and carrier it sits on, and each frame
 * it transmits. Inbound: the frames that reach its antenna, applied to the
 * addressed slot's model.
 *
 * The messages are JSON, payloads base64, times in microseconds on the
 * sender's own clock and meaningful only against each other. A station sends
 * one per datagram; the ether sends one, or, to a station that says `lines`
 * in its hello, every message of an instant in one datagram, a line each,
 * which the station applies as one (ether_link.cpp, handleDatagram). A
 * station ignores a message it does not understand.
 * SIMesh/ether/README.md is the wire.
