/* BUSY as the board's chip spends it, from SIM_MESH_BOARD (busy.h, which the
 * LR2021's model reads too): `busy_us` names the commands that keep BUSY high
 * and for how long, `<command>:<µs>` entries separated by commas, each command
 * named as the datasheet names it, bare or as `sx1262.<command>` (an entry
 * qualified with another chip's name is that chip's, and nothing here); and
 * `busy_tcxo` 1 holds BUSY through the TCXO's start-up (`oscReadyUs`, the
 * delay the firmware programmed with SetDIO3AsTCXOCtrl) after every command
 * that needs the oscillator, SetTx included, its own figure counted from the
 * start-up's end. A driver waits BUSY out as on a board. While BUSY is high
 * after a command that changes the radio's mode or tuning, or calibrates it,
 * the radio is deaf: the state it sends says when it is ready again
 * (`ready_at`, never before the reference has started), and the ether tells
 * it of nothing that starts before then but energy. Unset, BUSY is never
 * busy, as before.
 *
 * Measured on a RAK board's SX1262, BUSY after each command in µs over 200
 * switches of channel and spreading factor. A driver that goes to STDBY_RC and
 * calibrates the image at every configure: CalibrateImage 6632, SetRx 5140
 * (some 5075 of it the TCXO's start after STDBY_RC, for the 5 ms the firmware
 * programs), SetModulationParams 92, SetRfFrequency 91, SetStandby 68,
 * SetPacketParams 33, SetTxParams 1: 12.36 ms a switch, 12.10 ms of it BUSY.
 * One that stays in STDBY_XOSC and calibrates only when the band changes:
 * SetRfFrequency 69, SetStandby 69, SetRx 65, SetModulationParams 61,
 * SetPacketParams 33, SetTxParams 1: 0.55 ms a switch, 0.34 ms of it BUSY.
 * (The LR2021's figures are beside its own model, model_lr2021.cpp.)
 * SetTx is not charged: its BUSY would hold the frame back, and the frame
 * goes on the air at the command.
 *
 * `host_us` holds BUSY that much longer after every transaction, reads
 * included: the board's own time for one, its SPI and its driver around it,
 * which a station computing in no time does not spend, and which a driver
 * that waits BUSY out before each transaction then pays as the board's did.
 * The switches above less their BUSY, 0.26 ms over the stock driver's nine
 * transactions and 0.21 ms over the other's eight, give some 29 µs. */
