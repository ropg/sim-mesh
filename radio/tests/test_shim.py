"""The time shim, in a stand-in station, against a fake conductor.

standin.c links the chip library and runs a thread that sleeps in 25 ms steps,
one in 40 ms timed condition waits, and an interval timer at 10 ms; it is started with the shim preloaded, in a
virtual-time run with the thread census on. The conductor here grants T only
up to what the station last asked for, as the ether does, and every event the
station prints must land at its own instant in node time.
