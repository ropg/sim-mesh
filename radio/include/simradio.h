/**
 * simradio — a virtual radio chip on a virtual SPI bus, and the station's link
 * to the ether. This is the SX1262's: the shared library libsimradio-sx1262.so.
 *
 * A firmware is compiled against this header and linked with
 * `-lsimradio-sx1262`, and its zip does not carry the library: sim-mesh
 * provides it when it starts the station (on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and its path in
 * SIM_MESH_RADIO_LIB), so a firmware keeps working when the chip model or the
 * ether's protocol changes. Its driver hands each SPI frame to
 * `simradio_transfer` exactly as it would put it on a bus, and reads the reply
 * the datasheet describes; the model times every frame on the air, raises the
 * IRQ bits a real chip raises, and tells the ether what it is doing. The ether
 * decides who hears what and hands the frames that reach this antenna back.
 *
 * Thread-safe throughout. Nothing here blocks the caller beyond the model's
 * own short critical section.

/* ---- The host's services ----

 * What the library needs of the process it runs in: a clock, timers, a lock,
 * a UDP socket and a thread to read it, and a log. A plain POSIX process needs
 * nothing: the library's own services are threads, and are used until a host
 * hands it others. A host with its own scheduler (FreeRTOS on the Linux
 * target) hands its own with `simradio_set_services`, before any other call.
 *
 * The rules every host's services keep, because the model relies on them:
 *
 * - the lock is recursive: a timer callback that took it can call into code
 *   that takes it again;
 * - a timer callback runs with the lock NOT held; the model takes it itself;
 * - `timer_start_once` on a timer that is already running restarts it from
 *   now, and `timer_stop` on one that is not running does nothing;
 * - `now_us` is monotonic, zero near the process's start;
 * - `udp_open` returns a connected, non-blocking socket bound to `bind_addr`,
 *   or -1; `spawn_reader` calls `on_datagram` with each datagram it reads. */
