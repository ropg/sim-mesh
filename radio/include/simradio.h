/**
 * simradio — an SX1262 on a virtual SPI bus, and the station's link to the
 * ether.
 *
 * A station links this library in place of a radio. Its driver hands each SPI
 * frame to `simradio_transfer` exactly as it would put it on a bus, and reads
 * the reply the datasheet describes; the model times every frame on the air,
 * raises the IRQ bits a real chip raises, and tells the ether what it is doing.
 * The ether (SIMesh/ether) decides who hears what and hands the frames that
 * reach this antenna back.
 *
 * Thread-safe throughout. Nothing here blocks the caller beyond the model's
 * own short critical section.
