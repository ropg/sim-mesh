"""The virtual ether: one UDP endpoint that carries frames between stations.

Stations announce themselves with `hello`, describe their radio with `state`
and hand over a transmission with `tx`; the ether answers `welcome`,
`rx_begin` and `rx_end`.

The level a frame arrives at comes from the loss table: every ordered pair of
nodes has a path loss per band (slt.py), and

    L = P_tx + G_tx + G_rx − loss(tx → rx) − 20·log10(f / f0)

with P_tx the power the frame itself went out at, the gains the nodes'
antennas and the last term the within-band correction from the table's centre
to the frame's carrier. A pair the table does not have, or has as +inf, is
never heard. The table arrives by direct call — `set_losses()` and its
relatives — from whatever is driving the run; the UDP wire to the stations
never mentions it, and a station never learns where it is.

Reception is decided at each receiver, from everything arriving there
(README.md, "What it models"; INTERNALS.md, "Reception"). Every transmission
whose carrier overlaps a receiver's bandwidth is interference there, whatever
its spreading factor or sync word; only a frame whose bandwidth, spreading
factor and sync word match the receiver's state, on its carrier, can be
decoded. The receiver locks on to a decodable frame at its preamble unless it
is already demodulating another that the new one does not lead by the
same-SF figure, and a frame it is locked on survives when, over every
stretch of its air, it clears thermal noise by its spreading factor's
demodulation threshold and each class of interference, summed within the
class, by that class's rejection figure. A station in `CAD` is told a frame is
arriving, and nothing more, when that frame is decodable there or the energy
in its band crosses the sense threshold. A slot that starts listening while a
frame is on the air is judged the same way at that instant: it can still lock
on while enough of the preamble is to come, and is told the energy otherwise.
A receiver that leaves RX for anything but TX mid-frame is not told how the
frame it was following ended.

With `pairwise` set the pairwise rule decides instead, on the same levels: a
frame is delivered where it is audible, the receiver takes a later frame only
when it leads the one in progress by the capture margin, and a frame survives
only by leading each audible same-carrier interferer by that margin, one at a
time and without summing.

Clocks. In a real-time run a station's `t` fields are its own clock and are
meaningful only relative to each other inside one message; the ether rebases
every frame onto its own monotonic clock and schedules from that, so the `t`
fields it sends back are ether microseconds. The offsets inside a frame
(`t_pre - t0`, `t_hdr - t0`, `t_end - t0`) are the transmitter's and are
carried through unchanged, which is what a receiver actually needs. In a
virtual-time run (`--time max` or `<k>x`) the ether is the conductor: its
clock is T, which it moves only when every station has answered its last
message with `idle`, and every message it sends carries T and the station's
`seq` (README.md, "Virtual time").

Every datagram in and out, except `idle` and `run`, is one tab-separated
line of the record: stamp (the wall clock in a real-time run, T in seconds in
a virtual one), direction, station id, JSON.
