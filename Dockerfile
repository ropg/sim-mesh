# SIMesh's image: the tools to build and run SIMesh on a machine that is not
# Linux. `simesh` builds it on first use and runs itself inside it, with the
# directory holding SIMesh mounted at its own path; nothing of SIMesh is copied
# in or built here.
#
# Ubuntu 24.04 because a device package's ELF is dynamically linked against that
# release's libc, libstdc++, zlib and libbsd, and a package runs only on the
# architecture it was built for: the image is pulled for the host's own
# architecture, which is the one `simesh devices refresh` fetches for.
#
# Holds:
#   - python3 with aiohttp and pyyaml (the front, simd, the ether, devices.py)
#     and pytest
#   - Node 22 and npm (the page's Quasar/Vite build; Vite needs a newer Node
#     than Ubuntu ships)
#   - gcc, g++, make and cmake (the chip library and the time shim)
#   - cargo via rustup, with the wasm32 target (the planner, the sergeyculum
#     kind)
#   - the station runtime: libstdc++, zlib, libbsd
#   - Reticulum and LXMF, the Python reference implementations a
#     standard_reticulum station runs, and what they need (cryptography,
#     pyserial), from PyPI
